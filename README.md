# CLI Calculator

## 📖 Description
A command-line based calculator built using Python as part of an online internship task.  
The application allows users to perform various arithmetic operations by selecting options from a menu.
Here I used if-else because I want to make it easy and working for each version, you can also use match-case for version above 3.10.  
** Here I use special charactera as a string thats why it is easy for me to use the operator for the desried operation. **
